Noooooo!!!!
The Vault

robotop
So he told you?...
blockbite
How do you know my secrets!?
spooky
WHAT!? How did you know my name!?!
sparky
My coin.. NOOOOOO!!!
You're pretty good at this
gandalfpotter
Ah, right you are.
neverending
You learn quickly!
mule
ahead
a head
GAH!! You have doomed us all!
zzzzzzZZZZZZZZZ
NO NO NO NO!!!
What do you think you're doing?
Those numbers, aren't they...
That was weird...
He could be watching right now...
You play as a cube
that can jump
Fine, I can wait.
I have an idea for a gamemode
Ready to leave yet?
Whenever you're ready...
So... whats up?
The back button is in the corner.
DUN DUN DUN!
Don't you get tired of clicking?
Maybe it's just my imagination
Or was it?
Look behind you!
I thought I saw something
...and there are spikes
nevermind...
I don't think cubes can walk
Nevermind...
Two cubes walk into a bar
wait... did they walk or slide?
Is that all you do?
I heard a joke the other day
I mean, isn't it boring?
Click click click
Click the back button
So I get rid of you
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Let me guess, you're gonna push the button?
What a surprise...
Are you always like this?
I mean, what's the point?
It was so beautiful
I called it 'Sparky'
You're here for my gold, aren't you?
I had a secret coin once
I hid it with my name as the password
Muahahaha!
Don't tell RubRub, but I stole an icon
He will never notice...
RubRub gave it to me as a present
No, I won't give you a hint...
I like the new Robot mode
I even have my own Robot
I won't tell you where it is...
It's definitely not on the support page.
You want a hint... don't you?
I've hidden a password in the game
That didn't go very well...
So you met the GateKeeper...
If I'm not, then I'm behind.
What am I?
Ok, I will give you a hint.
Without it, I'm dead.
I said no...
You will have to ask RubRub...
Why are you still here?
You're so stubborn
I mean... oh no...
I DIDNT TELL YOU ANYTHING!
Like he has a better name
What does 'Glubfub' mean anyway?
I heard he made fun of me
Made fun of 'Sparky'...
It's so quiet...
Except for the annoying music
I have to admit
It does get lonely sometimes
Gah, I forgot the word
Those animals that are stubborn
Stubborn as a Fox...
wait, that's not right
There's a trail hidden somewhere
But RubRub didn't tell me where
...no ending
That's like 5 hints
It never ends
It doesn't have an end
Just keeps looping
Over and over and over
Gryffindor!
Secrets secrets secrets...
Whichever comes first
Sneaky hobbitses...
Fly, you fool!
...or use the force
...or what the password is
You will have to ask him
Page three was page six
Made it really hard to read
The pages were weird
Page one was page two
Maybe we are in a twilight zone?
Reminds me of a book I read
It's hard to keep track of
makes me feel Lost...
But maybe you can stop him?
Maybe you are the key?
He knows every move I make
Every move YOU make
...unless he's already here
Watching, waiting, lurking...
I don't feel good about this...
RubRub will be back soon
You're not supposed to be in here...
RubRub won't like this...
There is no spoon
I should have hid this room better...
What are you poking around for?
Don't you have better things to do?
zzzZZZZ
How did you get in here?!
Sneaky sneaky...
It's my precious...
Can't you just leave?
This is not the room you are looking for...
Why U touch my stuff?
RubRub better not find you in here...
zzzZZZZ...
Don't touch that!
Just, stop bothering me
I'm gonna stop talking
Go collect some stars
Maybe there are new levels?
You're gonna get me in trouble...
This is getting ridiculus...
You shall not pass!
Don't push the button!
Fine, press the button
Happy now?
You're hopeless...
Really, still here?


Challenge
Huh!?

The


Vault of Secrets

Oh I know!
I left an old chest down in the <co>basement</c>.
RubRub always gives prizes.
Uhm<d010>.<d010>.<d010>.<d030> Not sure what to<d010>.<d010>.<d010>.
<d010>.<d010>.<d010>.<d030> Why are you still here?
Ah of course,<d030> you want a <cg>prize</c>.
My level<d010>.<d010>.<d010>.<d040> You beat it?
I guess I underestimated you.<d030>
It will not happen again.
Its too dangerous, just stay here.
Leave that alone...
Not allowed
Sorry,<d020> I can't let you in.
Grab the chest and come back<d010>.<d010>.<d010>.
<d050><cr><i>DONT</i> <d050><i>TOUCH</i> <d050><i>ANYTHING</i></c>!
You are not prepared.
<d030>Collect more diamonds...
You can have that as a <cg>reward</c>!
Take the <cy>door</c> on the right, I will open it for you.
Off. <d030> Limits.
Does the word locked mean nothing to you?
Some things are best left alone.
Even I dont want to go down there.
I've only been down there once. <d030>Its pretty creepy.
Just forget about it.
That area is off limits.
I keep that door locked.
<d030>RubRub's orders.

I should have been a doctor...
Ugh... Slippery
I wish I had that many shinies...
NOOOO!! THIEF! THIEF!
Impressive...

Indeed it is...

rubrubpowah123
I heard what you did
You little thief
You know, for my head...
Nothing? Ok...
I feel so drained
Would be nice to get some energy
RUBRUBRUBRUBRUBRUB
Oh my head...
Too clever for you...
This is thread 4
But you will never get my coin...
I keep it safe
I like it
I know what you're thinking
You took 'Spookys' coin
That is pure evil...
My question to you is this...
On a scale from tree to fish
A very short Witch
The Witch stinks of fish
A very short tree
In this tree there lives a Witch
Thread 4 end
So... there is a tree
'I hope you are leaving'
Can you go now?
'Remove my start and I am even'
'When you complete this riddle'
Since you insist on staying
'I have always been odd'
How many shinies do you have?
Might as well give you a riddle
I need to get some rest...
Want to hear a secret?
... and the chicken said
The password is on fire
The egg, of course.
Then the egg laid the chicken
Which came first?
The chicken or the egg?
I have heard about you
%s the sneaky one...
But probably not...
RubRub will never notice me
I call it "The Challenge"
Hope it gets featured
Just don't tell RubRub
I am building my own level
Door is now open. Oh wait, no it's not.
Is that actually your guess?
Swing and a miss!
I told you, it wont work...
Why you touch my stuff?
No, just no
You think you can fool me
You are deeply mistaken
Don't make me angry
You won't like me when im angry...
That tickles!
Try harder please
Give up, please
Door is still locked
Go home %s.
Nope
How about no?
%s, please give up...
Just kidding, unlimited attempts
Maybe you should do something else?
Only 2 attempts left!
LAST ATTEMPT!
Oh no, you just unlocked... NOTHING
Only 3 attempts left!


What kind of name is %s anyway?
Not gonna work.
May I suggest thinking?
WRONG
Error, error. Bad answers.
Failure








<cy>Help</c> me get out of here, and I will make it worth your while.
See those locks over there?<d040>
<cl>You need to unlock them.</c>
<cr>Well,<d010> well,<d010> well.</c><d050>
What do we have here?
You look like someone who is interested in a <cl>deal</c><d010>.<d010>.<d010>.
Only a chosen <cl>few</c> can find it, but I will grant you this <cg>gift</c>...
Complete the <cr>Chaos Gauntlet</c>, and the <cl>key</c> will be yours<d010>.<d010>.<d010>.
The first <cl>key</c> is hidden in a <co>secret gauntlet</c>...
<cr>There was no chicken...</c>
I cannot stay here any longer.<d050>
<cr>You must find a way to release me.</c>
<cl>RubRub</c> locked me in here, for no reason.
He said there would be chicken.
<cg>You will find The Gatekeeper at the end of the world.</c>
<cg>Touch the ground beneath the promise, and the door will be revealed.</c>
I suspect it is guarded by <cr>The Gatekeeper</c>.
<d030><cl>RubRub</c>'s trusted pet.<d010>.<d010>.<d010>.
To claim the <co>key</c> you must fool him.
<d040>I do not know how.
Unlock <cy>50</c> secret chests to claim the <cg>key</c>.
The <co>third key</c> is hidden well.
<d030>Even I have not been able to find it.
They tried to <cl>hide</c> it from me,
but I have my <cr>spies</c>.
The <cg>second key</c> is locked away in a <cl>secret chest</c>.
Now that I have my <cg>freedom</c>,<d020>
I must continue where I left off.
<cy>RubRub</c> told me he was cooking some chicken.<d080> Then he locked me in.
I<d030>.<d030>.<d050>.<d030> I am <cg>free</c>...<d02>?
So many years lost.<d050> <cl>Locked</c> away in that filthy cage...

Excellent, only <cl>two</c> locks left.
You found a second <cg>key</c>, impressive<d010>.<d010>.<d010>.

<cr>You will need it</c><d030>.<d035>.<d040>.
Hey I heard some noi...
But I almost forgot, I left you a small <cg>gift</c>. <d050>As a token of my appreciation.
You should <cy>prepare</c> yourself for when I return.
Now that you have freed me, I can continue my master plan.
<cr>DESTROY</c> the world of <cg>Geometry Dash</c>!<d060> And I couldn't have done it without you <cl>%s</c>.

Chamber of Time
Something you always ruin...
Impressive
Hot answer, well done
I hide behind rocks and rills
A pizza would be nice
Be like water my friend
Can you feel it closing in?
Shadows creep where it begins
what am I?
Shh, quiet!
nor heard or smelt
the more I am the less you see
under the mountains and hills
I cannot be seen or felt
The less you consume
the stronger I become
Has a bed, but never sleeps
Has a mouth, but never eats?
What always runs, but never walks
Often murmurs, never talks
Speak its name and it is gone
from every moment dusk till dawn
You seem to be skilled in the art of <co>deception</c>...
But it does not matter, your <cl>trickery</c> ends here.
My rain dries up all the land it touches
Wait, you are not <cl>RubRub</c>...
My thunder comes before my lightning
My lightning comes before my rain
wait too long
and death will come
How long will you keep this up?
Don't you have other things to do?
None shall pass
You test my patience
Leave this place
You are not welcome here
<cr>Leave now, <d010>before you cause more problems<d010>.<d010>.<d010>.</c>
Why have I been awoken?
Tick tock
Time is running out
El pollo ardiente...
Ok, playtime is over
Can you smell it?
Chicken, burning chicken
Gah I can't stand this anymore!
The smell, it's killing me
Not what I was hoping for...
Really? Still here?
